# SQL DATA EXPLORATION OF COVID DATASET
This project is about exploring and the Covid dataset by using SQL querying skills and other skills such as CTE, temp tables and visualizing some queried tables by Power BI to have a better sense of the dataset

## 3. Step-to-step process:
- Collecting data from the data source
- Importing downloaded data into the MS SQL Sever Management Studio

- Exporting the SQL code file in .sql and 4 small files to .xlsx file
- Importing 4 small files into Power BI
- Visualizing some basic graphs and charts
- Exporting a .pbi  and .png file of the visualization
## 4. Products:
- SQL Code (MS SSMS) (uploaded file on Github)
